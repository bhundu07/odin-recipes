    <h2>Lasagna</h2>
    <p>Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait.</p>
    <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
    <h3>Lasagna Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat: 1 pound sweet Italian sausage and ¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>Onion and garlic: ½ cup minced onion and 2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>Tomatoe products: 1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes, 2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce and 2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
        <li>Water: ½ cup water</li>
        <li>Sugar: 2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings: 4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided, 1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves, 1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste, 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, ½ teaspoon fennel seeds, ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles: 12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Cheese: 16 ounces ricotta cheese, ¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced, ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Egg: 1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
